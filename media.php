Digital and transit advertising firm Digital Mara and Kenya Railways have unveiled fresh branding to boost experiences for rail passengers.</p><p>

The partnership is designed to tap revenues for Kenya Railways from the digital out-of-home advertising segment which is growing by about 11 per cent globally.</p><p>

Digital Mara’s operations director Anthony Stow said rail network offers an excellent opportunity for brands.</p><p>

''Our fresh new brand image as Digital Mara illustrates our Kenyan spirit and lends more energy to the digital advertising solution which we have been providing to Kenya Railways since 2019,'' Stow said. </p><p>

He added that they are working in partnership with LG Electronics for the screens on the rail network and the one at KBC. The firm has also partnered with Huawei on some of the Wi-Fi solutions. </p><p>

Digital Mara recently launched a free Wi-Fi service at the Kenya Railways Nairobi Central Station as part of the new phases of development that Digital Mara is undertaking on the Kenya Rail platform.</p><p>

Kenya Railways Acting general manager Business and Operations Milly Omido said the organization had set ambitious goals in line with the Government vision which they aim to deliver and surpass.</p><p>

“Why did we start this journey? Firstly, to generate revenue for Kenya Rail, but more importantly to bring life to the stations helping us to highlight alternative transport for commuters traveling across Nairobi and our growing network across Kenya,” Omido said.
